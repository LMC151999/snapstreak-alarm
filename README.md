Note:

 * Google Play releases have a different package name than others. You can install both at the same time, but there are no planned functional differences other than supporting me by paying. 

 * GitHub and F-Droid releases have the same package name, but they are signed by different keys (my own key vs. F-Droid key) so cross-update is not possible without first removing it.
