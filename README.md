Note:

 * Google Play releases have a different package name than others. You can install both at the same time, but there are no planned functional differences other than supporting me by paying. 

 * GitHub and F-Droid releases have the same package name, but they are signed by different keys and cannot cross-update without the app removed.


My first app project! :) Got it done before I turn 18.

## Features
* Custom reminder interval from 1 to 22 hours
