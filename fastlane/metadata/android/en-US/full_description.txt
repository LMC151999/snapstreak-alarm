Only works if you have friends.

Ever lost streaks with your friends or loved ones? Not anymore with this app! It reminds you of streaks as often as you like, and allows you to open Snapchat and close the reminder right within the reminder.

This is my first app! :)

Features:
 -  Custom reminder interval from 1 to 22 hours
 -  Notification stays until streaks are sent so you won't miss it
 -  Snooze reminder for custom amount of time
 -  Show when reminders are displayed in Notification Schedule
 -  Mark streaks sent directly in notification and close reminder
 -  Mark streaks sent directly through home screen shortcut
 -  Mark streaks sent some time earlier
 -  Open Snapchat directly from notification
 -  Automatically disable notifications if ignored for long time
 -  ...more coming!
